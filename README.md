This is the entire Helium programming language-

return {int};

This is all it can do and it can't even do all the ints. Just 0-255. Anything higher or lower as input will loop around to the equivalent value like its a clock :)

Very easy to extend and I'll probably play with it sometimes and maybe change the file extension from .he to something funnier.
